This is a project I made using Javascript and Bootstrap for the front end, and Laravel and SQL for the back end. This is my first full CRUD project using Laravel as well as Bootstrap.

This project has a simple focus. It is an employee database with the ability to create, view, update, and delete employees. Employees have 2 traits: name and salary.
